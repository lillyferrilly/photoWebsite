<div class="indent"><p>I am a Computer Science student at the University of Vermont, though my interests stretch far past the technologic world.</p>
<p>Growing up in North Ferrisburgh, Vermont, I was introduced to natureâ€™s beauty at a very young age. I developed a great respect for the outdoors, spending the better half of my childhood playing in mud, climbing trees, playing tag on open lawns, hiking, kayaking, fishing, and exploring.</p>
<p>With such a small-town upbringing, moving to Burlington to attend UVM was a significant change for me. My experiences here have introduced me to a whole different, yet equally rewarding part of the world. I have been to new restaurants and stores; met new people and spent time with old friends; and have gotten to call another Vermont town home.</p>
<p>I have always been interested in taking up photography as a hobby and this overwhelming change of place is what ultimately inspired me to act on the interest. Walking through unfamiliar streets and seeing so many unfamiliar places and faces, made me long for a way to document these new experiences. I bought my first 35mm camera, a Nikon n6006, and lens, a 50mm 1:1.8 D Nikkor lens, in September 2012, around the same time I moved into my first apartment.</p>
<p>Today, I continue snapping photos.</p>
